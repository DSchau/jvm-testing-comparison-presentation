## Routing

[//]: <> (Note, kinda like ui-router in angularjs)
[//]: <> (Note, be sure to talk about what pathMatch means)

Adding children
```
import { ProjectListComponent } from './project-list/project-list.component';
import { ProjectNewComponent } from './project-new/project-new.component';

export const routes: RouterConfig = [
  {
    path: 'projects',
    component: ProjectListComponent,
    children: [
      {
        path: 'new',
        component: ProjectNewComponent,
        pathMatch: 'full'
      }
    ]
  },
];
```
