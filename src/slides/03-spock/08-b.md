## Use the router

[//]: <> (Note, this is a simplified example. Typically the programmatic router would be used dynamically, e.g. if a condition is met)

```typescript
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private router: Router) {
  }

  go(path) {
    this.router.navigateByUrl(path);
  }
}
```
