```typescript
export class ProjectNewComponent {
  project: Project;

  constructor(private projectService: ProjectService, private router: Router) {
    this.project = new Project({name: '', description: ''});
  }

  save() {
    this.projectService.save(this.project)
      .subscribe(() => this.router.navigate(['/projects']));
  }
}
```
